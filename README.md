# MyTinerary

A tourism destinations webpage made as a project for MindHub Bootcamps. This repository is for the front page development, made with React+Vite

### Design: I made the whole design in Figma, using a green palette to stimulate a calming sense of renewal in the user. Used a sass stylesheet.

### Development: Made with ReactJS + Vite, vanilla JS, React Router Dom, React Redux. The project has a server-side.
